                    Note:
                    * Terminal vs GUI
                      + Command line
                      + Native VSCode GUI extension
                      + Native JetBrains extension (beta)
                    * Model - Models
                      + `/model`
                      + Sonett 4.5
                        - To code
                        - 200k vs 1m tokens
                      + Opus
                        - Thinking model
                        - To plan - default in plan mode
                        - More expensive and slower
                      + Modes:
                        - `Tab key`
                        - Thinking/normal
                    * Commands
                      + Where to put them
                      + Parameterization
                      + Usage `/my-command`
                    * Subagents
                      + `/agents`
                      + Orchestrated by main agent
                      + Isolated from main context
                      + Example:
                        - Gather requirements where you can use Context7
                        - Commit message subagent to make commits
                    * Hooks
                      + Enforce test, linter, etc execution with 100% pass
                      + Prevent editing what's locked, ie integration tests
                    * Tool usage
                      + Bash commands
                      + MCP Servers

                    ## Basic Prompting

                    - Action + Location + Detail <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Information Dense Keywords <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Mid-level prompt (not too high, not too low) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Provide Examples <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Define Output Format <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Further techniques <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

                    Note:
                    * Action + Location + Detail
                    * Information Dense Keywords:
                      + Keywords:
                        - Create
                        - Update
                        - Mirror
                        - Search

                    * Define Output Format
                      + Defined json/yaml/etc syntax
                      + Not always follow it - enforce with validation → later
                    * Further techniques:
                      + Define edge cases
                      + Ask the agent to improve your prompt
                      + Ask to ask back questions to clarify
                      + Deep research in ChatGPT
                      + Keywords: think, think hard, think harder, ultrathink

                    ## Basic Context Engineering

                    - Good Context <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Context Management <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Model focus <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Memory <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Referencing files <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Adding folders to scope <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Don't change by hand if possible <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - RAG - Retrieve Augment Generate <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

                    Note:
                    * Good Context
                      + Small
                      + Contains only what's in scope
                      + Keep track of context usage
                        - cli tool or gui
                        - `/context`
                    * Context Management
                      + Resuming previous
                        - `/resume`
                      + Compacting
                        - `/compact`
                        - What it does
                        - Avoid it
                      + Clearing / Starting new
                        - `/clear` or `start new claude`
                        - When to create new context
                        - What to add to the new context from the previous one
                    * Model focus
                      + Beginning and especially end of context
                    * Memory
                      + CLAUDE.md
                      + Common bash commands
                      + Core files and utility functions
                      + Coding standards&rules
                      + Building&Testing instructions
                      + Repository etiquette (e.g., branch naming, merge vs. rebase, etc.)
                      + Developer environment setup (e.g., pyenv use, which compilers work)
                      + Any unexpected behaviors or warnings particular to the project
                      + Other information you want Claude to remember
                      + API References and dependency documentation links
                      + Add CLAUDE.md to important subfolders also
                    * Referencing files
                      + `@filename.md`
                      + Needed on bigger projects with lot of files
                    * Adding folders to scope
                      + `/add-dir`
                    * Don't change by hand if possible
                      + Let it fix the issue
                      + Let it execute the bash script it wrote
                      + If you really need to, tell about the changes (ie link files) and reasons
                    * RAG - Retrieve Augment Generate
                      + File based
                      + MCP servers - later

                    ## Workflow

                    - Plan <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Low-level tasks <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Execute <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Validation <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Code Review <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
                    - Commit/rewind <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

                    Note:
                    * Plan
                      + Iterative planning in markdown
                      + Involve AI in plan generation
                      + Define
                        - High-Level Objective
                          * Describe what the feature or system does — the outcome or purpose.
                        - Mid-Level Breakdown
                          * Break the high-level goal into concrete, deliverable components — the building blocks.
                        - Implementation Notes
                          * These define technical details, rules, and constraints for how the work should be done.
                        - Context (Input (starting point) + Output)
                          * Define the boundaries of the codebase visible to the AI — what it can read and should modify.
                      + Request to clarify questions (multiple iterations)
                      + Human review
                    * Low-level tasks
                      + The step-by-step implementation plan — ordered, explicit tasks that the reasoning model can execute.
                        - Built in vs markdown based
                          * Built in for small task, few steps
                          * Markdown for bigger
                        - Reasonable, demoable size for each task
                        - Execution order
                        - Human review
                    * Execute
                      + One task at a time
                      + Separate context when possible
                      + Optional improvement: Write tests first (TDD) OR write tests and code together
                    * Validation
                      + Best if it can be done by the model itself (ie test running, script execution, etc)
                      + Reflection
                        - test runs
                        - linters
                        - type check
                        - build result
                        - Static analysis reports
                        - screenshots
                        - error logs
                        - diffs
                        - HTTP response codes
                        - load times
                        - HAR file diffs
                        - Dataset shape or schema mismatches
                        - CSV/JSON parse errors
                      + Ask for a Demo (even partial results)
                        - Self-evaluated demos are the best
                        - Quick human evaluation
                      + Hooks - later
                      + Larger tasks:
                        - Ask to Double check if the implementation meets the requirements
                    * Code Review
                      + Automatic review
                        - PromptCollection `/code-review` command
                        - `/review` - only for Github
                      + Human review
                        - Never trust AI generated code especially in production
                    * Commit/rewind
                      + If good, commit after each task
                      + If not, ask to modify or `/rewind` to previous checkpoint
